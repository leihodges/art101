				<h3>Problems</h3>
				<p>We had an easy time working on the everday task challenge. However, when it came to creating the pseudocode for our computer game
					we found that we kept forgetting out elements that seemed like "common knowledge". What helped us was pretending like we were 
					getting ready to play the game in class. I think playing through the game allowed us to see the main steps to get ready to play
					and what elements (# of players, setting up the board, etc.) are necessary to play. We also had a bit of trouble organizing our 
					JS into steps and sub-steps but again, after walking through the game and the example we think we organized it correctly.
