                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>For this lab we were required to create an HTML site with some changes to the CSS code. The requirements included the header "Hello World" and a paragraph
                    about ourselves and our lab partner. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I had a few issues with figuring out how to resize images and changing the style/size of the border in CSS. I ended up going on the W3Schools site and inspecting
                Professor Modes' site to try and see if I could find what elements were missing from my own code.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>For this lab I spent most of my time within CSS. I was a bit frustrated when I started because I kept forgetting certain elements like semi-colons but once
                    I started getting the hang of it I had a lot of fun experiementing with colors and fonts.

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>I was able to complete the creation of my HTML website and make some changes to the color, sizing, font, and images within the website.</p>
