			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<h4>By Leilah Hodges and Phoebe Rettberg</h4>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab we were asked to work in JS to declare an array that listed our transport and declare an object that
						collected the data we provided in the previous lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It took a couple tries for my JS to work. I found that JS wasn't as forgiving as HTML with typos or duplicate conventions.
						Phoebe was able to help look really closely at my JS code and find some of the errors that were preventing it from working. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Below is our data list we created in JS.</p>
