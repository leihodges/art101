				<h2> About Me!</h2>
				<p> Hello! My name is Leilah and I'm from the Berkeley area in the Bay Area. I'm currently in my third year of college as an Art major and I primarily do 
					painting and drawing. I love anything related to music (concerts, album art, music videos, etc.) but I can't play a single instrument and I'm a terrible 
					singer. I'm also really into movies. Some of my favorite movies of all time are "Ocean's Twelve," "10 Things I Hate About You," and "Tron". After college 
					I'm really interested in projects that combine technology and art and I'm hoping to do some something that combines the arts and entertainment, maybe 
					animation or storyboard art for games and movies.
				</p>
